        <div><h1>AMD's part at Computex</h1></div>
        <hr/>
        <h2>The recent live stream from Computex happened on the 1st of June by AMD. In this event, Lisa Su announced a couple of good news.</h2>

            <h4> NEW 3RD GEN EPYC CPUs <br> </br>
            Starting with their EPYC processors, Lisa Su showed how much better their CPUs are, which performs nearly 100,000 more java operations per second than intel's Xeon while being cheaper in comparison. Then they follow up by claiming with claiming their 3rd gen server processor to be the best in the world of servers.
            <br></br>
            NEW ZEN 3 BASED APUs<br></br>
            Following up with the zen 3 processors firstly they showed the new 5000 desktop APUs they were asked for these ryzen 7 5700g and ryzen 5 5600g. These processors could most probably help the DIY pc builders around the world which are not able to get GPUs on MSRP and can't spend much on GPUs. They showed the performance by running rogue company on the system without an actual GPU.
            These CPUs will hit the market from 5th August 2021 in which ryzen 5 5600g would be priced at 259 dollars and ryzen 7 5700g priced at 359 dollars. Now future will tell whether we would be able to get these on their respected msrp.
            <br></br>
            THEIR COLLABORATION WITH TESLA<br></br>
            Lisa Su then continued to announce, how their RDNA GPUs have hit the road with tesla model S and tesla model X. Which Elon Musk also teased in his early tweet.
            <br></br>
            It happens to have a Ryzen APU for infotainment and the RDNA GPU which produces up to 10 teraflops of power kicks in as you play those AAA titles. AMD says it wants to bring gamers a new platform.
            RDNA2 IN MOBILE PHONES <br></br>
            AMD will also make rdna 2 GPUs for high-performance mobile phones partnering with Samsung and their Exynos CPUs and are hoping to bring ray tracing and variable rate shading capabilities and said that "we're hoping from Samsung to providing more details in this year.
            <br></br>
            RX 6000 SERIES GPUs FOR LAPTOPS <br></br>
            AMD brings RDNA 2 GPUs in laptops via Radeon RX 6000m series. Later on, Scott Herkelman continues to tell more about the RDNA 2 architecture brought in laptops. 
            Which provides more performance than RDNA and the same performance while being 50-60 watts lower. Then carries on and tells about their Radeon software and how it can optimize the laptop for low battery consumption and to save battery life while gaming. 
            The GPUs coming to the laptops are the RX 6600m, RX 6700m, and RX 6800m.
            <br></br>
            AMD FIDELITYFX SUPER RESOLUTION <br></br>
            Later in the event of AMD's fidelity fx super resolution, AMD's equivalent of DLSS was announced which have 4 different quality option according to the buyer's need and it can be used on as much every GPU not only Radeon graphics but also Nvidia's old GPUs which are not provided by NVIDIA's DLSS option which is only available for their RTX series cards which would be available from June 22nd. 
            <br></br>
            ZEN 3 CPUs WITH NEW 3D STACKING V-CACHE TECHNOLOGY<br></br>
            Here Lisa Su shows AMD's new CPU packaging design in which they put 3d v-cache directly above the core complex which is directly bonded to each other by silicon and provides up to 2 TB/s of bandwidth. Later on, Lisa Su went on and showed the 3d stacking technology physically on the processor herself.
            <br></br>
            This new technology provided a nearly 15% average increase in gaming performance just by 3d V-Cache technology. 
            <br></br>
            These all could be confirmed when new zen 3 the CPUs with 3d chiplet design would be on sale by the end of 2021.</h4>
